General overview:
    Card based chore organizing system. 
    Cards can be organized with border color.
    Every card has a title and description.
    Depending on the priority the card background color changes.
    Every card has a toDO date, depending on the current one it will either be green or red.
    Every card has a button for removing the cards from the stack.

UI/UX:
    Simple design.
    Navbar is at the bottom of the page(where everything is controlled at).
    At the top of the page is the app name and Dark mode option.
    At the middle is the toDO section, when cards overflow, it is scrollable to the right.
    Cards with higher priority are listed before.

What technologies are needed?
    -vanilla CSS, HTML, JS.
    -webpack for managing all of this.
    -some kind of date system for dates.
    -localStorage for saving the chores.
